PABLO definition
================

PABLO is a small protocol for controlling a wide array of internet services.
We expect 95% of all internet traffic to consist of PABLO messages by 2015.
The binary nature of PABLO makes encryption unnecessessary since nobody can
read that stuff anyway. PABLO is likely to be the first protocol to be awarded
the nobel peace price.

PABLO relies on the assumption that the client is dumb and shouldn't have to
be updated whenever a server add new features. To accomplish this, the client
is command-agnostic and supports general input commands which enables the 
client to collect inputs and display outputs without understanding the function
of the individual commands.

Protocol: Two formats: Binary-format and command-format.

Binary format
--------------

	Binary format is used to transfer data of arbitrary length. I.e strings.

    Bytes   |   Function
    ----------------------
    0       |   Message format identifier
    1..4    |   Content length, signed int
    5..n    |   Message data, n = 5 + content length



Command format
--------------

	Every command message is exactly 10 bytes, the format looks as follows. The first
	byte (the "command byte") identifies the action to be executed by the reciever. The
	following two integers can be used to transfer data relevant to the command. The
	last byte is one or more flags used to carry addtional information.

    Bytes   |   Function
    ----------------------
    0       |   Command byte
    1..4    |   4-byte integer nr 1
    5..8    |   4-byte integer nr 2
    9       |   Flags


   
Specified Command Codes
=======================

Designated command ranges:
--------------------------

    Code    |   Function
    ----------------------
    0x0             |   Reserved. Unwise to begin with null-byte.
    0x01 .. 0x4F    |   Reserved for bank action commands.
    0x50 .. 0x6F    |   Reserved for client actions. (UI related methods, etc)
    0x70 .. 0x8F    |   Reserved for server actions.
    0x90 .. 0xEF    |   Not reserved.
    0xF0 .. 0xFD    |   Reserved for binary commands.
    0xFE, OxFF      |   Special
    
    
The flag field:
---------------
    
	The flag field is a bitmask built from the following enumeration:

    Value   |   Flag
    ---------------------
    0x01    |   Failure
    0x02    |   Unauthorized
    0x04    |   Request
    0x08    |   Response
    
   
Command Codes and their fields:
-------------------------------

	hex     |   command               |     nr 1      |   nr 2    |Binary |

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	NOTES:
	
	1. The commands marked with "B" must be sent using the binary format.
	2. "msg code" Denotes a reference to a string to be displayed before the
       action is carried out.
    3. "return cmd" Is the command to execute the collected values with.
    4. The protocol specifies commands for transferring and setting languages
       but does not specify the format of the integer specifying indvidual messages
       nor the format of the binary file transferred over the update command(0xFC).
	
	
	

Scenarios
=========

	The protocol assumes that the client is dumb and does not contain any kind of business logic. 
	Therefore, all actions must be initiated by the server.
	
	The server must take the first step after connection establishment.
